I found that this time around, going through the process of understanding and refining concepts so that they can be implemented into the frontend to be much smoother than the first project. From my weekly mentor meetings, I felt that I was able to get a better grasp on how to implement syncs, which was something I did not really understood even after the first project. I was also able to work with my coding agent much faster than before, which sped up implementing frontend changes.


As I mostly worked on the UI for this project, it was at first difficult to come up with a design that could accomodate all of the features that we were planning to add in series over the course of the project. As this was an extension of Artem's personal project, I decided to take his initial design from that project, which had a left sidebar and a centered content component, and worked my way from there, moving certain features (like the profile) to the sidebar.

I do think our team communication over the course of the project could have been a bit better. Usually we would not decide when or where to meet until the day before said meeting. On our group chat, responses from people asking questions would sometimes take a while to be addressed. However, I beleieve that everyone did a great job in letting others know their availability, and what tasks they can contribute to over the course of a week. Everyone would make progress on our repositories over the course of a week, rather than the day before key deadlines.

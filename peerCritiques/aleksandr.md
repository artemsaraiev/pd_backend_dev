# Peer Critique (team SEAL)

## What are some aspects of the project that you like, and why?

The problem is REAL, impulsive purchases happen, and if self-control is not enough, external service may be beneficial.
I feel like one great thing about the project is that if it actually works and the person uses it on a regular basis,
it provides a very rewarding feeling, associated with overcoming base urges, and maintaining consumption awareness and
consciousness. Another point of praise for me is very broad, thorough, and exhaustive evidence base for the issue, exposing
the nature and consequences of impulsive purchases in everyday life.

## What are some aspects of the project that you wish were different in some way?

I feel that that a separate web app already creates too much friction. Impulsive purchases are called like that for a
reason;  they happen almost instantly, and "prevention window" is very narrow, maybe even too narrow for a separate web
app. Narrowness of prevention window also renders social part of the app almost useless, since in the case of impulsive
purchases the decision is made way before other people can vote for/against the purchase. However, if one looks at this
from another point of view, if the urge to share the purchase idea in the app is stronger than the impulse to buy, then
it kind of counts as a success? Even though the entire functionality can be ignored, app still can be useful. Paradoxical,
but cool.

## What are some aspects you are wondering about; perhaps some suggestions for a simplification, a different approach, or whatever?

I think I've said it during the Q&A session, but I genuinely feel like this would work the best as a browser extension
rather than a separate web app. I'm also not sure about the public visibility of the purchases for the community, is there
an option to hide it from others? I feel like this is necessary for privacy, but at the same time, it ruins the idea as it
removes peer-pressure component in preventing impulsive purchases.

# Thursday 12/04

## Agenda
- Discuss our deliverable for the beta checkpoint (10 minutes max)
- Show live instance of the project for any changes made after beta submission (10 minutes max)
- Discuss next plans and uncertainties and receive feedback (ideally 30 minutes)
- Final Questions (10 minutes)

## Design Changes from Last Meeting

* Highlighting and anchor contexts have been successfully implemented
  * We wanted clickable highlights to point to its associated thread. Right now, we just have the thread display the anchor id that corresponds to the highlight (and location on the paper)
* The current implementation has open pubs, i.e. anyone can sign in and make a thread on any paper, different from the closed-pub design we envisioned.

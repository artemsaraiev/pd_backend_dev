# Thursday 11/13

## Agenda
- Discuss our project’s purpose (10 minutes)
- Discuss and feedback on our proposed new features (20 minutes)
- Discuss about any uncertainties about the project that you may notice right now (20 minutes)
- Final Questions (10 minutes)

In the past week, we decided to make our project address the same problem that Artem’s personal project aimed to solve: reducing the friction of discussing academic research online.

## Design Changes from Last Meeting

None

## Issues

One feature we would like to implement is a highlighting feature that allows users to highlight and make comment annotations on papers, where other users can see the highlights and respond to existing comments. We are concerned about the feasibility of implementing this feature.

## Plans & decisions

We plan to work on our project pitch and functional design together this Saturday during our weekly meeting time as specified in our team contract. We will discuss ideas for the format of the video for our project pitch over the next few days. On the functional design, we aim to choose the best features among the ones we proposed on our problem framing assignment, which will become the basis of our project.

# Thursday 11/20

## Agenda
- Discuss our planned deliverables for the alpha checkpoint and uncertainties (See [functional design](../final_project_framing/final_project_func_design.md)) (20 minutes)
- Final Questions (10 minutes)

Since Artem won't be here, this meeting will probably take less time.

## Design Changes from Last Meeting

None

## Issues

We are still unsure of how to implement selective and permanent highlighting on the rendered PDFs. A user's highlights on a paper should be saved (for themselves), and highlights should appear under Threads at the specific section they highlighted.

We also wanted to discuss about our plan for preserving context for threads, i.e. what happens when a user who makes a thread deletes their thread. Our idea was to implement something similar to how Reddit does, where the content and user of the deleted comment are no longer visible, but all replies underneath should be preserved. The deleted comment gets "frozen", i.e. no more comments can be added to it.

## Plans & decisions

Given our deliverables, we have not decided on an absolute time to meet up over the next couple of days yet, but we discussed the possibility of Artem and Rahsun meeting on Friday, and everyone working together for a couple of hours during the weekend. We also need to discuss (with everyone) about the timeline day-wise regarding our future deliverables during and immediately after Thankgsiving break
